### Briefly About Myself:

Having started my career as a freelance photographer, I became proficient and kind of popular.
My keen interest in content-making led me to working as an SMM Manager in the advertising agency,
where I continued self-learning, examining the process of creating ads, TikToks, and other social network content.

Remote work as an SMM Manager gives me extra free time, which I spend learning Frontend Development.
I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,
besides there’s a huge amount of free high-quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I'm excited to bring my creativity and passion to the world of web development, creating visually stunning and user-friendly experiences.
I'm ready to make a difference and grow professionally in this new journey!

### Code example:
**Peak array index KATA from CODEWARS:** *Given an array of ints, return the index such that the sum of the elements to the right of that index equals the sum of the elements to the left of that index. If there is no such index, return -1. If there is more than one such index, return the left-most index*  

```javascript
function peak(arr) {
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    let leftSum = arr.slice(0, i).reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);
    let rightSum = arr.slice(i + 1).reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);
    if (leftSum === rightSum) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
