### Breiefly About Myself:

Having started my career as a freelance photographer, I became profficient and kind of popular.
My keen interest in content-making led me to working as a SMM Manager in the advertising agency,
where I continued self-learning, examining the process of creating ads, tiktoks and other social networks' goods.

Remote work as a SMM Manager gives me extra free time, which I spend learning Frontend Development.
I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I'm excited to bring my creativity and passion to the world of web development, creating visually stunning and user-friendly experiences. 
I'm ready to make a difference and grow professionally in this new journey!
